              <p class="mb-0 text-secondary small">
                The data from both ABS-CBN and GMA during Typhoon Karding underscores the critical role of media
                coverage on social media in shaping public awareness, emotional response, and real-time action during
                natural disasters. The contrast in engagement levels between the two networks—ABS-CBN's tweets averaging
                hundreds to thousands of reposts and likes, versus GMA’s typically lower double-digit figures—reveals
                how content framing, timing, and platform resonance impact audience behavior.
                <br /><br />
                ABS-CBN’s tweets, particularly those providing urgent warnings—such as signal advisories and expected
                impact zones—and emotional appeals like prayers or community aid, saw substantial amplification through
                reposts and high like counts. For instance, one tweet warning about “catastrophic effects” received
                nearly 3,000 likes and 1,388 reposts, indicating a strong public impulse to share actionable and
                emotional content. These high-engagement posts demonstrate that effective disaster communication on
                social media must be immediate, emotionally resonant, and easily shareable.
                <br /><br />

                Meanwhile, GMA’s content—although similarly informative—generally garnered less engagement. Their
                updates focused more on formal announcements and institutional efforts, which, while important, appeared
                less emotionally engaging or urgent in tone. Posts highlighting government coordination or late-stage
                weather developments attracted minimal interaction. This difference suggests that audiences on platforms
                like Twitter are more responsive to content that feels directly relevant to personal safety or community
                welfare, rather than institutional updates.
                <br /><br />
                From a broader perspective, this analysis highlights the vital importance of media organizations on
                social media as both information disseminators and emotional anchors during crises. High engagement can
                help ensure that critical updates reach wider audiences quickly, enabling faster preparation, response,
                and even recovery. Social media dynamics—especially the speed and scale of user amplification—can turn a
                single tweet into a life-saving alert or a rallying point for aid.
                In sum, the effectiveness of media coverage in disasters is deeply tied to how well it leverages social
                media's strengths: timeliness, emotional engagement, clarity, and shareability. The ABS-CBN and GMA data
                not only reflect differing levels of engagement but also reveal how media organizations must
                continuously adapt their digital strategies to ensure that life-saving information truly reaches—and
                moves—the public.

                  Based on the numbers in the dataset, the engagement metrics—reposts, likes, and replies—reveal how
                  users responded to different types of tweets during Super Typhoon Karding. The tweet with the highest
                  engagement overall is Tweet 2, which warned of the typhoon’s catastrophic effects and called for
                  immediate preparation. It received 1,388 reposts and 2,990 likes, indicating that users saw it as
                  highly urgent and important to share. Similarly, Tweet 0, a prayer post, had 731 reposts and 2,651
                  likes, showing strong emotional resonance and a shared sense of hope or solidarity. Tweets that
                  reported significant updates, such as signal number changes (Tweets 6 and 5), also had high reposts
                  (493 and 272 respectively) and hundreds to over a thousand likes, reflecting the audience’s desire to
                  spread critical information.
                  Replies, though generally lower, spiked in Tweet 8 with 84 replies, where the focus shifted to the
                  lack of post-typhoon aid in an affected community. This suggests that users were more likely to
                  respond or engage in discussion when a tweet addressed a perceived injustice or unmet need. Other
                  tweets had minimal replies, ranging from 2 to 21, suggesting that news-style bulletins are typically
                  not conversational but rather informative. Overall, the data shows that the public is most
                  responsive—in both amplification and emotional engagement—to tweets that are either highly urgent
                  (disaster warnings) or deeply resonant (prayers, calls for help), with the numbers reflecting distinct
                  user behaviors depending on the content’s nature.

                <p class="text-secondary small">
                  The GMA Network dataset reflects a significantly lower level of engagement compared to the ABS-CBN
                  dataset, based on the numerical data for reposts, likes, and replies. The most engaged tweet in this
                  set—Tweet 2, reporting that President Marcos Jr. was in contact with Cabinet officials—garnered only
                  56 reposts, 174 likes, and 11 replies, suggesting moderate public interest in leadership updates.
                  Tweets invoking prayer or offering emotional appeals (like Tweet 1) had slightly better performance
                  with 23 reposts and 90 likes, indicating that faith-based messaging had some traction, though still
                  limited.
                  In general, most tweets across the dataset received fewer than 25 reposts, under 100 likes, and 1 or
                  no replies, with several tweets (e.g., Tweets 8–13) having virtually no engagement at all. Tweets
                  about weather updates post-landfall, which typically included technical details, were the least
                  engaged, often receiving 0–1 reposts or likes. This suggests a decline in public interest once the
                  peak of the typhoon had passed or that these updates lacked urgency or emotional appeal.
                  Overall, the data shows that while GMA disseminated timely and relevant updates, the posts were less
                  amplified and interacted with by users. This could reflect differences in audience behavior, post
                  content style, or platform strategy. Numerically, the lower engagement suggests that users were either
                  less compelled to share or emotionally invest in GMA’s posts or were more focused on other sources,
                  such as ABS-CBN, for information and expression during Typhoon Karding.

              The data reveals a noticeable difference in the volume and nature of social media posts related to Typhoon
              Henry between the community and the government. The community’s posts, totaling 10 tweets, focus largely
              on grassroots relief efforts, volunteer coordination, urgent calls for donations, and sharing emergency
              contact information. These posts are characterized by personal appeals and updates on localized aid
              activities, reflecting a bottom-up response driven by individuals, volunteer groups, and small
              organizations aiming to provide immediate support to affected communities. The government’s posts, on the
              other hand, also number 10 but tend to emphasize official disaster response mechanisms, mobilization of
              resources, coordinated relief efforts by government agencies, and public service announcements. Government
              posts generally have higher engagement metrics such as likes and reposts, which indicates broader
              visibility and reach, possibly due to official accounts and their established followership. Overall, while
              both sectors are active, the community’s social media activity is more informal, urgent, and focused on
              mobilizing help directly on the ground, whereas the government’s messaging aims to inform the public about
              ongoing organized response efforts and institutional readiness. This comparison highlights the
              complementary roles of community-driven initiatives and official government responses in managing disaster
              relief — the community acts as immediate responders and communicators of urgent needs, while the
              government coordinates large-scale resources and provides authoritative information to the public. This
              dynamic interplay is crucial in enhancing disaster resilience and ensuring timely aid reaches those
              affected by Typhoon Henry.
              <br><br>
              This section provides a rich dataset for SMD by illustrating how social media facilitates <strong>collective action</strong> and <strong>community mobilization</strong> during disasters. The distinct characteristics of community posts (grassroots, urgent, personal appeals) versus government posts (official, resource-focused, broader announcements) highlight different communication strategies and network behaviors. The community's focus on immediate, localized needs demonstrates the power of social media in enabling rapid, decentralized responses. The observation that government posts have higher engagement despite the community's direct action focus is significant for SMD; it may point to the established reach and <strong>network centrality</strong> of official accounts, or a public tendency to engage with authoritative information sources even while participating in grassroots efforts. This data is relevant for understanding the symbiotic relationship between formal and informal response networks, the flow of information and resources between them, and how social media platforms serve as a crucial interface for coordinating diverse efforts in disaster management.

            <p class="mb-0 text-secondary small">
              In comparing the social media engagement of ABS-CBN and GMA on posts related to Typhoon Henry (#HenryPH),
              ABS-CBN demonstrated a significantly higher overall interaction due to its more consistent and frequent
              updates. ABS-CBN posted three separate tweets about the typhoon, accumulating a total of 998 likes, 388
              reposts, and 72 replies. In contrast, GMA had only one tweet regarding Typhoon Henry, which gathered 589
              likes, 214 reposts, and 50 replies. Interestingly, both networks posted the exact same bulletin on August
              31, 2022—announcing the entry of Super Typhoon Hinnamnor into the Philippine Area of Responsibility under
              the local name “Henry”—and both received the same amount of reposts (214) and replies (50) on that
              specific post, suggesting a high level of audience engagement with this particular update regardless of
              source.
              Despite this equal performance on the overlapping post, ABS-CBN’s additional tweets provided more timely
              updates, allowing them to gain an edge in total engagement. One of ABS-CBN’s earlier posts from 2018
              gathered 171 likes, 75 reposts, and 2 replies, while a follow-up bulletin in September 2022 added another
              238 likes, 99 reposts, and 20 replies to their overall numbers. These figures show that ABS-CBN’s strategy
              of posting multiple times during the course of the typhoon’s development helped them generate 409 more
              likes, 174 more reposts, and 22 more replies than GMA overall.
              In summary, while GMA’s single post was strong in performance, ABS-CBN’s broader coverage and frequent
              updates on Typhoon Henry led to higher total engagement. This highlights the value of consistent,
              real-time reporting during major weather events, as it helps media organizations reach and inform a larger
              audience.
              <br><br>
              This comparative analysis is central to SMD, particularly in understanding <strong>media effects</strong>, <strong>agenda-setting</strong>, and <strong>audience engagement</strong> on social platforms during crises. The higher engagement for ABS-CBN, linked to update frequency, illustrates the importance of sustained information flow in maintaining audience attention and perceived relevance. The identical engagement on the overlapping critical bulletin suggests that for high-stakes information, the message itself can temporarily override source preference, a key finding for crisis communication. However, the overall higher engagement for ABS-CBN points to the impact of consistent presence in building a more engaged audience network over time. This data is relevant for studying how media outlets compete for attention and disseminate information in a crowded digital landscape, and how content strategies (e.g., frequency, timeliness) influence their effectiveness and reach within their respective social media ecosystems.

                The two doughnut charts above compare the engagement metrics (likes, reposts, and replies) of the most-liked tweet from government-affiliated sources against the most-liked tweet from community-driven initiatives concerning Typhoon Carina.
                The chart on the left ("Top Government Post") visualizes the engagement for a tweet by Angat Buhay, which garnered <strong>830 likes, 299 reposts, and 8 replies</strong>. This post detailed their relief operations, showcasing a significant, though more moderate, level of public interaction typical of official updates on aid distribution.
                The chart on the right ("Top Community Post") displays the engagement for a tweet by 1Z ENTERTAINMENT. This post, which shared emergency hotline information, achieved substantially higher engagement with <strong>9118 likes, 4485 reposts, and 40 replies</strong>. This indicates a strong public response to actionable safety information disseminated by a community-focused or entertainment-related entity.
                <br><br>
                This comparison is highly relevant to Social Media Dynamics as it illustrates differing patterns of <strong>information diffusion</strong> and <strong>network influence</strong> during a crisis. The government post represents a traditional, top-down communication model, while the community post's higher engagement, particularly in reposts, signifies rapid, peer-to-peer amplification of immediately actionable information. This highlights the power of <strong>decentralized networks</strong> and non-traditional influencers (like an entertainment entity) in crisis communication. The data underscores how perceived utility and shareability of content can drive virality, bypassing official channels. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for SMD researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize crisis response by leveraging both authoritative sources and the organic reach of community-driven content. It also touches upon <strong>source credibility</strong> and <strong>public trust</strong>, as users may prioritize actionable information from accessible sources regardless of official status.

                The pie charts above compare the engagement metrics (likes, reposts, and replies) of the single most-liked tweet related to disaster preparedness and response for Typhoon Henry, contrasting a top post from government-affiliated sources with one from community channels.
                The chart on the left ("Top Government Post (Preparedness)") showcases a tweet by Leni Robredo regarding the Angat Buhay office's 24-hour operation for receiving in-kind donations for Typhoon KristinePH. This post achieved significant engagement with <strong>10,654 likes, 6,157 reposts, and 0 replies</strong>, highlighting strong public interest and support for donation drives led by prominent public figures and established organizations.
                The chart on the right ("Top Community Post (Preparedness)") features a tweet by KapusoMoJessicaSoho sharing a list of emergency hotlines. This post garnered <strong>859 likes, 1,196 reposts, and 6 replies</strong>. While the like count is lower than the top government post, the high number of reposts indicates the community's drive to disseminate actionable safety information.
                <br><br>
                This data offers valuable insights into SMD by contrasting engagement patterns for preparedness information. The high likes for the government-affiliated post, driven by a well-known public figure (Leni Robredo), demonstrate the impact of <strong>influencer effects</strong> and <strong>source authority</strong> in mobilizing support (donations). Conversely, the community post's high repost count for emergency hotlines underscores the public's propensity to amplify practical, life-saving information, reflecting strong <strong>information utility</strong> driving its spread. This distinction is key to SMD, showing how different message types and sources trigger varied engagement behaviors (liking as endorsement/support vs. reposting as dissemination). Understanding these nuances helps in crafting targeted preparedness campaigns that leverage both influential voices for resource mobilization and community networks for broadcasting critical alerts, thereby enhancing <strong>collective resilience</strong>.
