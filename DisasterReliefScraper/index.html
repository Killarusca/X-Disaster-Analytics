                The data from both ABS-CBN and GMA during Typhoon Karding underscores the critical role of media
                coverage on social media in shaping public awareness, emotional response, and real-time action during
                natural disasters. The contrast in engagement levels between the two networks—ABS-CBN's tweets averaging
                hundreds to thousands of reposts and likes, versus GMA’s typically lower double-digit figures—reveals
                how content framing, timing, and platform resonance impact audience behavior.
                <br /><br />
                ABS-CBN’s tweets, particularly those providing urgent warnings—such as signal advisories and expected
                impact zones—and emotional appeals like prayers or community aid, saw substantial amplification through
                reposts and high like counts. For instance, one tweet warning about “catastrophic effects” received
                nearly 3,000 likes and 1,388 reposts, indicating a strong public impulse to share actionable and
                emotional content. These high-engagement posts demonstrate that effective disaster communication on
                social media must be immediate, emotionally resonant, and easily shareable.
                <br /><br />

                Meanwhile, GMA’s content—although similarly informative—generally garnered less engagement. Their
                updates focused more on formal announcements and institutional efforts, which, while important, appeared
                less emotionally engaging or urgent in tone. Posts highlighting government coordination or late-stage
                weather developments attracted minimal interaction. This difference suggests that audiences on platforms
                like Twitter are more responsive to content that feels directly relevant to personal safety or community
                welfare, rather than institutional updates.
                <br /><br />
                From a broader perspective, this analysis highlights the vital importance of media organizations on
                social media as both information disseminators and emotional anchors during crises. High engagement can
                help ensure that critical updates reach wider audiences quickly, enabling faster preparation, response,
                and even recovery. Social media dynamics—especially the speed and scale of user amplification—can turn a
                single tweet into a life-saving alert or a rallying point for aid.
                In sum, the effectiveness of media coverage in disasters is deeply tied to how well it leverages social
                media's strengths: timeliness, emotional engagement, clarity, and shareability. The ABS-CBN and GMA data
                not only reflect differing levels of engagement but also reveal how media organizations must
                continuously adapt their digital strategies to ensure that life-saving information truly reaches—and
                moves—the public.

                  Based on the numbers in the dataset, the engagement metrics—reposts, likes, and replies—reveal how
                  users responded to different types of tweets during Super Typhoon Karding. The tweet with the highest
                  engagement overall is Tweet 2, which warned of the typhoon’s catastrophic effects and called for
                  immediate preparation. It received 1,388 reposts and 2,990 likes, indicating that users saw it as
                  highly urgent and important to share. Similarly, Tweet 0, a prayer post, had 731 reposts and 2,651
                  likes, showing strong emotional resonance and a shared sense of hope or solidarity. Tweets that
                  reported significant updates, such as signal number changes (Tweets 6 and 5), also had high reposts
                  (493 and 272 respectively) and hundreds to over a thousand likes, reflecting the audience’s desire to
                  spread critical information.
                  Replies, though generally lower, spiked in Tweet 8 with 84 replies, where the focus shifted to the
                  lack of post-typhoon aid in an affected community. This suggests that users were more likely to
                  respond or engage in discussion when a tweet addressed a perceived injustice or unmet need. Other
                  tweets had minimal replies, ranging from 2 to 21, suggesting that news-style bulletins are typically
                  not conversational but rather informative. Overall, the data shows that the public is most
                  responsive—in both amplification and emotional engagement—to tweets that are either highly urgent
                  (disaster warnings) or deeply resonant (prayers, calls for help), with the numbers reflecting distinct
                  user behaviors depending on the content’s nature.

                <p class="text-secondary small">
                  The GMA Network dataset reflects a significantly lower level of engagement compared to the ABS-CBN
                  dataset, based on the numerical data for reposts, likes, and replies. The most engaged tweet in this
                  set—Tweet 2, reporting that President Marcos Jr. was in contact with Cabinet officials—garnered only
                  56 reposts, 174 likes, and 11 replies, suggesting moderate public interest in leadership updates.
                  Tweets invoking prayer or offering emotional appeals (like Tweet 1) had slightly better performance
                  with 23 reposts and 90 likes, indicating that faith-based messaging had some traction, though still
                  limited.
                  In general, most tweets across the dataset received fewer than 25 reposts, under 100 likes, and 1 or
                  no replies, with several tweets (e.g., Tweets 8–13) having virtually no engagement at all. Tweets
                  about weather updates post-landfall, which typically included technical details, were the least
                  engaged, often receiving 0–1 reposts or likes. This suggests a decline in public interest once the
                  peak of the typhoon had passed or that these updates lacked urgency or emotional appeal.
                  Overall, the data shows that while GMA disseminated timely and relevant updates, the posts were less
                  amplified and interacted with by users. This could reflect differences in audience behavior, post
                  content style, or platform strategy. Numerically, the lower engagement suggests that users were either
                  less compelled to share or emotionally invest in GMA’s posts or were more focused on other sources,
                  such as ABS-CBN, for information and expression during Typhoon Karding.

                          The community responses to Typhoon Henry, as presented in the tweet dataset, highlight how
                          ordinary citizens engage in information sharing, emotional expression, and public discourse
                          during weather disturbances. The tweets show a mix of informative content, personal reactions,
                          and commentary on public safety issues such as class suspensions and flooding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Notably, certain users such as meteorologist Ariel Rojas garnered high engagement, with over
                          1,000 likes on a single tweet. This shows that trusted figures become central sources of
                          credible information during crises. Meanwhile, other tweets use humor or relatable hashtags
                          like <em>#WalangPasok</em> to reflect community sentiment, showcasing how social media acts as
                          a mirror for shared anxieties and hopes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          From a social media dynamics standpoint, the data underscores how crises stimulate high online
                          interaction. Tweets that provide clarity, context, or emotional resonance are more likely to
                          be amplified through likes and reposts. This illustrates the power of social media in shaping
                          real-time narratives and mobilizing communities in the face of natural disasters.

                          The tweets from PAGASA-DOST during Typhoon Henry primarily focus on issuing timely warnings
                          and updates regarding rainfall levels and storm developments. These messages play a crucial
                          role in public safety, ensuring that individuals and institutions can prepare for potential
                          flooding and severe weather impacts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The government tweets received high engagement — the most reposted warning had over 230 shares
                          and 500 likes, indicating a strong level of trust and responsiveness from the public. The
                          repeated dissemination of rainfall warnings and cyclone bulletins also reflects a strategy of
                          consistent information flow, which is essential in managing disaster risk.

                        <p>
                          From a social media dynamics perspective, this dataset underscores the role of government
                          agencies as authoritative voices in crisis communication. Their tweets tend to be formal,
                          factual, and structured — serving as a reliable backbone in an ecosystem where misinformation
                          can easily spread. The significant interaction they receive highlights the value of
                          institutional presence and credibility in online disaster discourse.

            <p class="mb-0 text-secondary small">
              Based on the collected data from both the community and the government, we can observe notable differences
              in their social media activity and engagement during Typhoon Henry (#HenryPH). The community produced a
              total of five posts, while the government, represented by PAGASA-DOST, released only three posts. While
              the graph focuses solely on the total number of posts, the broader analysis considers the likes, reposts
              (retweets), and replies to better understand user engagement.
              <br /><br />
              The community's posts generated a total of 2,138 likes, 847 retweets, and 25 replies. In contrast,
              government posts garnered 1,152 likes, 548 retweets, and a higher number of 59 replies. This suggests that
              while the community generated more content and received higher engagement through likes and retweets, the
              government’s posts prompted more direct interaction, as reflected in the number of replies. These replies
              likely came from users seeking clarification or further updates, which is typical when dealing with
              official announcements during emergencies.
              <br /><br />
              Community users such as Ariel Rojas and The Varsitarian contributed significantly to the high engagement
              levels, using their platforms to inform, clarify misinformation, and provide real-time updates from local
              areas. These posts were often more relatable and emotionally resonant, which may explain the surge in
              likes and shares. On the other hand, government tweets were formal, direct, and informational—serving as
              trusted bulletins rather than conversation starters.
              <br /><br />
              This dynamic illustrates a common pattern in social media during crises: government agencies act as
              authoritative sources, delivering verified and timely information, while community members function as
              amplifiers, commentators, and localized informants. Together, they form a collaborative information
              ecosystem. The likes and retweets reflect content that resonates emotionally or socially with users, while
              replies highlight users’ need for clarity, reassurance, or more detailed answers.
              <br /><br />
              From an academic perspective, especially in courses related to media, communication, or data science, this
              comparison highlights the evolving role of social media in public discourse and crisis communication. It
              underscores the importance of analyzing both quantitative metrics (like post count and engagement rates)
              and qualitative dynamics (such as content type and tone) to understand how information flows and
              influences public behavior during critical events.
              <br><br>
              This section provides a rich dataset for SMD by illustrating how social media facilitates
              <strong>collective action</strong> and <strong>community mobilization</strong> during disasters. The
              distinct characteristics of community posts (grassroots, urgent, personal appeals) versus government posts
              (official, resource-focused, broader announcements) highlight different communication strategies and
              network behaviors. The community's focus on immediate, localized needs demonstrates the power of social
              media in enabling rapid, decentralized responses. The observation that government posts have higher
              engagement despite the community's direct action focus is significant for SMD; it may point to the
              established reach and <strong>network centrality</strong> of official accounts, or a public tendency to
              engage with authoritative information sources even while participating in grassroots efforts. This data is
              relevant for understanding the symbiotic relationship between formal and informal response networks, the
              flow of information and resources between them, and how social media platforms serve as a crucial
              interface for coordinating diverse efforts in disaster management.

            <p class="mb-0 text-secondary small">
              Based on the compiled data regarding social media activity related to Typhoon Henry (#HenryPH), we can
              observe how GMA Integrated News and ABS-CBN News used their platforms and how the public engaged with
              their content. The focus of the chart for these two media outlets is on the total number of likes,
              reposts, and comments (replies) received across their posts.
              <br /><br />
              GMA Integrated News posted a total of seven tweets related to Typhoon Henry. These posts collectively
              garnered 48 likes, 19 reposts, and 6 replies. While the volume of GMA's tweets was relatively high, the
              engagement per post was modest. Most of GMA’s content focused on weather updates, hazard warnings, and
              forecasts, which are highly informative and helpful for public safety but tend to elicit less emotional or
              viral responses. Their highest-performing tweet in terms of likes received 19 likes, and the most
              retweeted post had 10 reposts. These figures suggest that while GMA maintained consistent coverage and
              aimed to inform their audience, the posts did not generate widespread interaction or viral traction.
              <br /><br />
              In contrast, ABS-CBN News posted only three tweets, but the engagement levels were significantly higher.
              These three tweets accumulated a total of 3,540 likes, 1,022 reposts, and 66 replies. One tweet in
              particular — a video showing the impact of Typhoon Henry on a concert venue — received 2,300 likes, 341
              reposts, and 31 replies, highlighting the strong emotional and visual impact of the content. This
              demonstrates how visual and human-interest content can dramatically increase engagement, even if fewer
              posts are made.
              <br /><br />
              Comparing both media outlets, we see that GMA had more frequent updates, likely aiming for consistent and
              real-time weather monitoring, while ABS-CBN leveraged fewer but more engaging content, capturing moments
              that resonated more with their audience. From an academic or media studies perspective, this comparison
              illustrates how content type and delivery style affect engagement metrics, even when covering the same
              event. It also reflects the importance of storytelling and visual elements in increasing interaction,
              especially in a fast-paced social media landscape where attention is fleeting and competition for views is
              high.

              The doughnut charts above compare engagement metrics (likes, reposts, replies) for two distinct types of
              community-driven posts during Typhoon Carina.
              The chart on the left ("Top Urgent Community Plea/Rescue Call") highlights the most engaged tweet that
              represented a direct, urgent appeal for rescue or immediate help from individuals affected by the typhoon.
              The chart on the right ("Top Organized Community Information/Aid Post") showcases the most engaged tweet
              from community groups or entities focused on disseminating critical information (like emergency hotlines)
              or coordinating organized relief efforts (like donation drives).
              This comparison aims to illustrate how different types of community-generated content garner public
              attention and interaction during a crisis, reflecting both the immediate needs of individuals and the
              broader efforts of community organizations.

              <strong>Social Media Dynamics Insights:</strong> This revised comparison within community data reveals how
              different crisis communication functions manifest on social media. Urgent pleas often trigger high
              emotional engagement and rapid sharing (virality) aimed at immediate intervention, demonstrating the
              platform's role in <strong>situational awareness</strong> and <strong>ad-hoc rescue coordination</strong>.
              Posts from organized efforts, on the other hand, showcase how communities leverage social media for
              <strong>resource mobilization</strong> (donations) and <strong>information dissemination</strong>
              (hotlines, advisories), often relying on established networks or clear calls to action. Analyzing these
              distinct engagement patterns is crucial for SMD to understand how to support both spontaneous individual
              cries for help and structured community-led responses, optimizing the flow of aid and information. For the
              field, this data highlights the diverse roles community actors play and the varying effectiveness of
              different message types in achieving specific response goals.

              The pie charts above compare engagement metrics (likes, reposts, replies) for two key types of disaster
              preparedness communication during Typhoon Kristine. The data is sourced from posts categorized into
              'guidance' and 'action' based on their content.
              The chart on the left ("Top Early Warning & Guidance Post") showcases the most-liked tweet focused on
              proactive advice, such as preparing go-bags or securing homes, aimed at helping the public prepare before
              the typhoon's peak impact.
              The chart on the right ("Top Resource & Action Mobilization Post") highlights the most-liked tweet calling
              for specific resources (e.g., donations, equipment) or actions (e.g., volunteers) needed to prepare for or
              manage the typhoon's consequences.
              This comparison illustrates the different facets of preparedness communication and how the public engages
              with them.
              <br><br>
              This categorization helps in understanding the flow of different types of preparedness information. "Early
              Warning & Guidance" posts are crucial for disseminating official advice and safety measures, and their
              engagement reflects public attentiveness to authoritative instructions. "Resource & Action Mobilization"
              posts, on the other hand, demonstrate active community participation and the leveraging of social media
              for logistical coordination and support rallying. Analyzing the engagement with these distinct message
              types provides insights into what motivates public interaction—be it seeking official guidance or
              contributing to collective efforts—which is vital for SMD in optimizing preparedness campaigns and
              fostering community resilience. For the field, this shows how varied communication strategies contribute
              to a holistic preparedness ecosystem.
