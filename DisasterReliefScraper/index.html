                The data from both ABS-CBN and GMA during Typhoon Karding underscores the critical role of media
                coverage on social media in shaping public awareness, emotional response, and real-time action during
                natural disasters. The contrast in engagement levels between the two networks—ABS-CBN's tweets averaging
                hundreds to thousands of reposts and likes, versus GMA’s typically lower double-digit figures—reveals
                how content framing, timing, and platform resonance impact audience behavior.
                <br /><br />
                ABS-CBN’s tweets, particularly those providing urgent warnings—such as signal advisories and expected
                impact zones—and emotional appeals like prayers or community aid, saw substantial amplification through
                reposts and high like counts. For instance, one tweet warning about “catastrophic effects” received
                nearly 3,000 likes and 1,388 reposts, indicating a strong public impulse to share actionable and
                emotional content. These high-engagement posts demonstrate that effective disaster communication on
                social media must be immediate, emotionally resonant, and easily shareable.
                <br /><br />

                Meanwhile, GMA’s content—although similarly informative—generally garnered less engagement. Their
                updates focused more on formal announcements and institutional efforts, which, while important, appeared
                less emotionally engaging or urgent in tone. Posts highlighting government coordination or late-stage
                weather developments attracted minimal interaction. This difference suggests that audiences on platforms
                like Twitter are more responsive to content that feels directly relevant to personal safety or community
                welfare, rather than institutional updates.
                <br /><br />
                From a broader perspective, this analysis highlights the vital importance of media organizations on
                social media as both information disseminators and emotional anchors during crises. High engagement can
                help ensure that critical updates reach wider audiences quickly, enabling faster preparation, response,
                and even recovery. Social media dynamics—especially the speed and scale of user amplification—can turn a
                single tweet into a life-saving alert or a rallying point for aid.
                In sum, the effectiveness of media coverage in disasters is deeply tied to how well it leverages social
                media's strengths: timeliness, emotional engagement, clarity, and shareability. The ABS-CBN and GMA data
                not only reflect differing levels of engagement but also reveal how media organizations must
                continuously adapt their digital strategies to ensure that life-saving information truly reaches—and
                moves—the public.

                  Based on the numbers in the dataset, the engagement metrics—reposts, likes, and replies—reveal how
                  users responded to different types of tweets during Super Typhoon Karding. The tweet with the highest
                  engagement overall is Tweet 2, which warned of the typhoon’s catastrophic effects and called for
                  immediate preparation. It received 1,388 reposts and 2,990 likes, indicating that users saw it as
                  highly urgent and important to share. Similarly, Tweet 0, a prayer post, had 731 reposts and 2,651
                  likes, showing strong emotional resonance and a shared sense of hope or solidarity. Tweets that
                  reported significant updates, such as signal number changes (Tweets 6 and 5), also had high reposts
                  (493 and 272 respectively) and hundreds to over a thousand likes, reflecting the audience’s desire to
                  spread critical information.
                  Replies, though generally lower, spiked in Tweet 8 with 84 replies, where the focus shifted to the
                  lack of post-typhoon aid in an affected community. This suggests that users were more likely to
                  respond or engage in discussion when a tweet addressed a perceived injustice or unmet need. Other
                  tweets had minimal replies, ranging from 2 to 21, suggesting that news-style bulletins are typically
                  not conversational but rather informative. Overall, the data shows that the public is most
                  responsive—in both amplification and emotional engagement—to tweets that are either highly urgent
                  (disaster warnings) or deeply resonant (prayers, calls for help), with the numbers reflecting distinct
                  user behaviors depending on the content’s nature.

                <p class="text-secondary small">
                  The GMA Network dataset reflects a significantly lower level of engagement compared to the ABS-CBN
                  dataset, based on the numerical data for reposts, likes, and replies. The most engaged tweet in this
                  set—Tweet 2, reporting that President Marcos Jr. was in contact with Cabinet officials—garnered only
                  56 reposts, 174 likes, and 11 replies, suggesting moderate public interest in leadership updates.
                  Tweets invoking prayer or offering emotional appeals (like Tweet 1) had slightly better performance
                  with 23 reposts and 90 likes, indicating that faith-based messaging had some traction, though still
                  limited.
                  In general, most tweets across the dataset received fewer than 25 reposts, under 100 likes, and 1 or
                  no replies, with several tweets (e.g., Tweets 8–13) having virtually no engagement at all. Tweets
                  about weather updates post-landfall, which typically included technical details, were the least
                  engaged, often receiving 0–1 reposts or likes. This suggests a decline in public interest once the
                  peak of the typhoon had passed or that these updates lacked urgency or emotional appeal.
                  Overall, the data shows that while GMA disseminated timely and relevant updates, the posts were less
                  amplified and interacted with by users. This could reflect differences in audience behavior, post
                  content style, or platform strategy. Numerically, the lower engagement suggests that users were either
                  less compelled to share or emotionally invest in GMA’s posts or were more focused on other sources,
                  such as ABS-CBN, for information and expression during Typhoon Karding.

            <p class="mb-0 text-secondary small">
              Based on the collected data from both the community and the government, we can observe notable differences
              in their social media activity and engagement during Typhoon Henry (#HenryPH). The community produced a
              total of five posts, while the government, represented by PAGASA-DOST, released only three posts. While
              the graph focuses solely on the total number of posts, the broader analysis considers the likes, reposts
              (retweets), and replies to better understand user engagement.

              The community's posts generated a total of 2,138 likes, 847 retweets, and 25 replies. In contrast,
              government posts garnered 1,152 likes, 548 retweets, and a higher number of 59 replies. This suggests that
              while the community generated more content and received higher engagement through likes and retweets, the
              government’s posts prompted more direct interaction, as reflected in the number of replies. These replies
              likely came from users seeking clarification or further updates, which is typical when dealing with
              official announcements during emergencies.

              Community users such as Ariel Rojas and The Varsitarian contributed significantly to the high engagement
              levels, using their platforms to inform, clarify misinformation, and provide real-time updates from local
              areas. These posts were often more relatable and emotionally resonant, which may explain the surge in
              likes and shares. On the other hand, government tweets were formal, direct, and informational—serving as
              trusted bulletins rather than conversation starters.

              This dynamic illustrates a common pattern in social media during crises: government agencies act as
              authoritative sources, delivering verified and timely information, while community members function as
              amplifiers, commentators, and localized informants. Together, they form a collaborative information
              ecosystem. The likes and retweets reflect content that resonates emotionally or socially with users, while
              replies highlight users’ need for clarity, reassurance, or more detailed answers.

              From an academic perspective, especially in courses related to media, communication, or data science, this
              comparison highlights the evolving role of social media in public discourse and crisis communication. It
              underscores the importance of analyzing both quantitative metrics (like post count and engagement rates)
              and qualitative dynamics (such as content type and tone) to understand how information flows and
              influences public behavior during critical events.
              <br><br>
              This section provides a rich dataset for SMD by illustrating how social media facilitates
              <strong>collective action</strong> and <strong>community mobilization</strong> during disasters. The
              distinct characteristics of community posts (grassroots, urgent, personal appeals) versus government posts
              (official, resource-focused, broader announcements) highlight different communication strategies and
              network behaviors. The community's focus on immediate, localized needs demonstrates the power of social
              media in enabling rapid, decentralized responses. The observation that government posts have higher
              engagement despite the community's direct action focus is significant for SMD; it may point to the
              established reach and <strong>network centrality</strong> of official accounts, or a public tendency to
              engage with authoritative information sources even while participating in grassroots efforts. This data is
              relevant for understanding the symbiotic relationship between formal and informal response networks, the
              flow of information and resources between them, and how social media platforms serve as a crucial
              interface for coordinating diverse efforts in disaster management.

            <p class="fw-semibold mb-1">GMA & ABS-CBN Data Comparison:</p>
            <p class="mb-0 text-secondary small">
              Based on the compiled data regarding social media activity related to Typhoon Henry (#HenryPH), we can
              observe how GMA Integrated News and ABS-CBN News used their platforms and how the public engaged with
              their content. The focus of the chart for these two media outlets is on the total number of likes,
              reposts, and comments (replies) received across their posts.

              GMA Integrated News posted a total of seven tweets related to Typhoon Henry. These posts collectively
              garnered 48 likes, 19 reposts, and 6 replies. While the volume of GMA's tweets was relatively high, the
              engagement per post was modest. Most of GMA’s content focused on weather updates, hazard warnings, and
              forecasts, which are highly informative and helpful for public safety but tend to elicit less emotional or
              viral responses. Their highest-performing tweet in terms of likes received 19 likes, and the most
              retweeted post had 10 reposts. These figures suggest that while GMA maintained consistent coverage and
              aimed to inform their audience, the posts did not generate widespread interaction or viral traction.

              In contrast, ABS-CBN News posted only three tweets, but the engagement levels were significantly higher.
              These three tweets accumulated a total of 3,540 likes, 1,022 reposts, and 66 replies. One tweet in
              particular — a video showing the impact of Typhoon Henry on a concert venue — received 2,300 likes, 341
              reposts, and 31 replies, highlighting the strong emotional and visual impact of the content. This
              demonstrates how visual and human-interest content can dramatically increase engagement, even if fewer
              posts are made.

              Comparing both media outlets, we see that GMA had more frequent updates, likely aiming for consistent and
              real-time weather monitoring, while ABS-CBN leveraged fewer but more engaging content, capturing moments
              that resonated more with their audience. From an academic or media studies perspective, this comparison
              illustrates how content type and delivery style affect engagement metrics, even when covering the same
              event. It also reflects the importance of storytelling and visual elements in increasing interaction,
              especially in a fast-paced social media landscape where attention is fleeting and competition for views is
              high.

              The two doughnut charts above compare the engagement metrics (likes, reposts, and replies) of the
              most-liked tweet from government-affiliated sources against the most-liked tweet from community-driven
              initiatives concerning Typhoon Carina.
              The chart on the left ("Top Government Post") visualizes the engagement for a tweet by Angat Buhay, which
              garnered <strong>830 likes, 299 reposts, and 8 replies</strong>. This post detailed their relief
              operations, showcasing a significant, though more moderate, level of public interaction typical of
              official updates on aid distribution.
              The chart on the right ("Top Community Post") displays the engagement for a tweet by 1Z ENTERTAINMENT.
              This post, which shared emergency hotline information, achieved substantially higher engagement with
              <strong>9118 likes, 4485 reposts, and 40 replies</strong>. This indicates a strong public response to
              actionable safety information disseminated by a community-focused or entertainment-related entity.
              <br><br>
              This comparison is highly relevant to Social Media Dynamics as it illustrates differing patterns of
              <strong>information diffusion</strong> and <strong>network influence</strong> during a crisis. The
              government post represents a traditional, top-down communication model, while the community post's higher
              engagement, particularly in reposts, signifies rapid, peer-to-peer amplification of immediately actionable
              information. This highlights the power of <strong>decentralized networks</strong> and non-traditional
              influencers (like an entertainment entity) in crisis communication. The data underscores how perceived
              utility and shareability of content can drive virality, bypassing official channels. Understanding these
              dynamics is crucial for SMD researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize crisis response by leveraging
              both authoritative sources and the organic reach of community-driven content. It also touches upon
              <strong>source credibility</strong> and <strong>public trust</strong>, as users may prioritize actionable
              information from accessible sources regardless of official status.

              The pie charts above compare the engagement metrics (likes, reposts, and replies) of the single most-liked
              tweet related to disaster preparedness and response for Typhoon Henry, contrasting a top post from
              government-affiliated sources with one from community channels.
              The chart on the left ("Top Government Post (Preparedness)") showcases a tweet by Leni Robredo regarding
              the Angat Buhay office's 24-hour operation for receiving in-kind donations for Typhoon KristinePH. This
              post achieved significant engagement with <strong>10,654 likes, 6,157 reposts, and 0 replies</strong>,
              highlighting strong public interest and support for donation drives led by prominent public figures and
              established organizations.
              The chart on the right ("Top Community Post (Preparedness)") features a tweet by KapusoMoJessicaSoho
              sharing a list of emergency hotlines. This post garnered <strong>859 likes, 1,196 reposts, and 6
                replies</strong>. While the like count is lower than the top government post, the high number of reposts
              indicates the community's drive to disseminate actionable safety information.
              <br><br>
              This data offers valuable insights into SMD by contrasting engagement patterns for preparedness
              information. The high likes for the government-affiliated post, driven by a well-known public figure (Leni
              Robredo), demonstrate the impact of <strong>influencer effects</strong> and <strong>source
                authority</strong> in mobilizing support (donations). Conversely, the community post's high repost count
              for emergency hotlines underscores the public's propensity to amplify practical, life-saving information,
              reflecting strong <strong>information utility</strong> driving its spread. This distinction is key to SMD,
              showing how different message types and sources trigger varied engagement behaviors (liking as
              endorsement/support vs. reposting as dissemination). Understanding these nuances helps in crafting
              targeted preparedness campaigns that leverage both influential voices for resource mobilization and
              community networks for broadcasting critical alerts, thereby enhancing <strong>collective
                resilience</strong>.
