                The data from both ABS-CBN and GMA during Typhoon Karding underscores the critical role of media coverage on social media in shaping public awareness, emotional response, and real-time action during natural disasters. The contrast in engagement levels between the two networks—ABS-CBN's tweets averaging hundreds to thousands of reposts and likes, versus GMA’s typically lower double-digit figures—reveals how content framing, timing, and platform resonance impact audience behavior.
                <br /><br />
                ABS-CBN’s tweets, particularly those providing urgent warnings—such as signal advisories and expected impact zones—and emotional appeals like prayers or community aid, saw substantial amplification through reposts and high like counts. For instance, one tweet warning about “catastrophic effects” received nearly 3,000 likes and 1,388 reposts, indicating a strong public impulse to share actionable and emotional content. These high-engagement posts demonstrate that effective disaster communication on social media must be immediate, emotionally resonant, and easily shareable.
                <br /><br />

                Meanwhile, GMA’s content—although similarly informative—generally garnered less engagement. Their updates focused more on formal announcements and institutional efforts, which, while important, appeared less emotionally engaging or urgent in tone. Posts highlighting government coordination or late-stage weather developments attracted minimal interaction. This difference suggests that audiences on platforms like Twitter are more responsive to content that feels directly relevant to personal safety or community welfare, rather than institutional updates.
                <br /><br />
                From a broader perspective, this analysis highlights the vital importance of media organizations on social media as both information disseminators and emotional anchors during crises. High engagement can help ensure that critical updates reach wider audiences quickly, enabling faster preparation, response, and even recovery. Social media dynamics—especially the speed and scale of user amplification—can turn a single tweet into a life-saving alert or a rallying point for aid.
                In sum, the effectiveness of media coverage in disasters is deeply tied to how well it leverages social media's strengths: timeliness, emotional engagement, clarity, and shareability. The ABS-CBN and GMA data not only reflect differing levels of engagement but also reveal how media organizations must continuously adapt their digital strategies to ensure that life-saving information truly reaches—and moves—the public.

                  Based on the numbers in the dataset, the engagement metrics—reposts, likes, and replies—reveal how users responded to different types of tweets during Super Typhoon Karding. The tweet with the highest engagement overall is Tweet 2, which warned of the typhoon’s catastrophic effects and called for immediate preparation. It received 1,388 reposts and 2,990 likes, indicating that users saw it as highly urgent and important to share. Similarly, Tweet 0, a prayer post, had 731 reposts and 2,651 likes, showing strong emotional resonance and a shared sense of hope or solidarity. Tweets that reported significant updates, such as signal number changes (Tweets 6 and 5), also had high reposts (493 and 272 respectively) and hundreds to over a thousand likes, reflecting the audience’s desire to spread critical information.
                  Replies, though generally lower, spiked in Tweet 8 with 84 replies, where the focus shifted to the lack of post-typhoon aid in an affected community. This suggests that users were more likely to respond or engage in discussion when a tweet addressed a perceived injustice or unmet need. Other tweets had minimal replies, ranging from 2 to 21, suggesting that news-style bulletins are typically not conversational but rather informative. Overall, the data shows that the public is most responsive—in both amplification and emotional engagement—to tweets that are either highly urgent (disaster warnings) or deeply resonant (prayers, calls for help), with the numbers reflecting distinct user behaviors depending on the content’s nature.

                 The GMA Network dataset reflects a significantly lower level of engagement compared to the ABS-CBN dataset, based on the numerical data for reposts, likes, and replies. The most engaged tweet in this set—Tweet 2, reporting that President Marcos Jr. was in contact with Cabinet officials—garnered only 56 reposts, 174 likes, and 11 replies, suggesting moderate public interest in leadership updates. Tweets invoking prayer or offering emotional appeals (like Tweet 1) had slightly better performance with 23 reposts and 90 likes, indicating that faith-based messaging had some traction, though still limited.
                In general, most tweets across the dataset received fewer than 25 reposts, under 100 likes, and 1 or no replies, with several tweets (e.g., Tweets 8–13) having virtually no engagement at all. Tweets about weather updates post-landfall, which typically included technical details, were the least engaged, often receiving 0–1 reposts or likes. This suggests a decline in public interest once the peak of the typhoon had passed or that these updates lacked urgency or emotional appeal.
                Overall, the data shows that while GMA disseminated timely and relevant updates, the posts were less amplified and interacted with by users. This could reflect differences in audience behavior, post content style, or platform strategy. Numerically, the lower engagement suggests that users were either less compelled to share or emotionally invest in GMA’s posts or were more focused on other sources, such as ABS-CBN, for information and expression during Typhoon Karding.

                The two doughnut charts above compare the engagement metrics (likes, reposts, and replies) of the most-liked tweet from government-affiliated sources against the most-liked tweet from community-driven initiatives concerning Typhoon Carina.
                The chart on the left ("Top Government Post") visualizes the engagement for a tweet by Angat Buhay, which garnered <strong>830 likes, 299 reposts, and 8 replies</strong>. This post detailed their relief operations, showcasing a significant, though more moderate, level of public interaction typical of official updates on aid distribution.
                The chart on the right ("Top Community Post") displays the engagement for a tweet by 1Z ENTERTAINMENT. This post, which shared emergency hotline information, achieved substantially higher engagement with <strong>9118 likes, 4485 reposts, and 40 replies</strong>. This indicates a strong public response to actionable safety information disseminated by a community-focused or entertainment-related entity, potentially amplified by a large existing follower base.
                This comparison highlights a notable difference in engagement scale. While the government-affiliated post provided crucial updates on relief efforts, the community post sharing emergency contact details saw over ten times the likes and reposts. This suggests that during a crisis, information perceived as immediately actionable and widely shareable, especially from accounts with broad appeal, can achieve massive reach. It underscores the power of community and non-traditional information sources in disseminating critical safety information alongside official channels.

                The pie charts above compare the engagement metrics (likes, reposts, and replies) of the single most-liked tweet related to disaster preparedness and response for Typhoon Henry, contrasting a top post from government-affiliated sources with one from community channels.
                The chart on the left ("Top Government Post (Preparedness)") showcases a tweet by Leni Robredo regarding the Angat Buhay office's 24-hour operation for receiving in-kind donations for Typhoon KristinePH. This post achieved significant engagement with <strong>10,654 likes, 6,157 reposts, and 0 replies</strong>, highlighting strong public interest and support for donation drives led by prominent public figures and established organizations.
                The chart on the right ("Top Community Post (Preparedness)") features a tweet by KapusoMoJessicaSoho sharing a list of emergency hotlines. This post garnered <strong>859 likes, 1,196 reposts, and 6 replies</strong>. While the like count is lower than the top government post, the high number of reposts indicates the community's drive to disseminate actionable safety information.
                This comparison reveals different strengths in communication. The government-affiliated post, leveraging a well-known personality, excelled in mobilizing support and donations, reflected in its high like count. The community post, from a media entity, demonstrated effectiveness in spreading critical, shareable information like emergency contacts, evidenced by its substantial reposts. Both types of posts play vital roles in a comprehensive disaster preparedness strategy, one by rallying resources and the other by ensuring vital information reaches a wide audience.
